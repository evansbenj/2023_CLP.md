# 2023_clivii_largeni_pygmaeus

This is a repo with Martin Knytl for the X. clivii, X. largeni, X. pygmaeus genomics project.

The goal of this project is to identify sex-linked regions in these species based on genomic data. 

# Searching for sex-specific heterozygous positions

For sex-linked regions, we expect divergence in the heterogametic sex and not the homogametic sex. We can identify these sites and map them.
